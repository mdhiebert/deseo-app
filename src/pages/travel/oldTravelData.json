It was right on the water with a pool and a dock. The next morning, a driver named Marco picked us up at 8:00 AM and drove us straight south to the ruins of Agrigento, an ancient Greek town. We spent the morning there and ate lunch in a small nearby town on the way home.\nOn August 2nd, we drove to Palermo and had a crazy time finding parking (\"Si Problem\"). We then took a four hour boat ride along the coast of Palermo - stopping twice to jump out and swim in the ocean and through caves. Afterwards, we grabbed lunch in Palermo and explored the city for the rest of the day. We spent the next day driving to Taormina, stopping at an ancient Roman villa along the way (to discuss interior design choices - *courtyards*). Taormina was beautiful.\nOur final day was spent at home, swimming and soaking up the sun.",

On August 8, we drove to Tavira, close to the border of Spain, and strolled through markets and ate lunch in a private club. On our way back westward to Burgau, we stopped at Praia das Salamitras, a secluded beach with a slightly treacherous climb to get to it.\nOn the 9th, we spent the day in Lagos and the surrounding beaches, driving all the way out to the most southwestern point in mainland Europe to round out the day. On our last full day in the region--the 10th--we kayaked through the caves of Benagil and spent the rest of the afternoon at the Praia do Carvalho. These four days were packed with sun, sand, and delicious Portuguese food. (We also saw Bella Montanaro).",

We arrived at The Ivens, where we were greeted with free luxury bottles of water and a surprise in our hotel room for our \"anniversary.\"We spent our first day strolling through many sights of Baixa de Lisboa and Barro Alto. On the 11th, we went to the Azulejos and Gulbenkian museums before ubering to the Torre de Belem and the birthplace of the Pasteis. The 12th--our last full day--was spent in Sintra (beautiful!) before celebrating Fran's birthday dinner at the Antikuario Cafe. Delicious food and top tier service. Lisbon was AMAZING.",
